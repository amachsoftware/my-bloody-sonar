## *My Bloody Sonar*<br> relies on the work of many people, mainly thanks to following projects:

- main inspiration (and some code ;) was taken from [My Bloody Jenkins](https://github.com/odavid/my-bloody-jenkins) by [Ohad David](https://github.com/odavid)

- post-init auto-configuration approach was peeked out from [terraform-aws-sonarqube](https://github.com/telia-oss/terraform-aws-sonarqube) by [Telia OSS](https://github.com/telia-oss)

- [aws-env](https://github.com/telia-oss/aws-env) a small handy utility for securely handling secrets also credits to [Telia OSS](https://github.com/telia-oss)

- And of course, it wouldn't make any sense without original [docker-sonarqube](https://github.com/SonarSource/docker-sonarqube) from [SonarSource](https://github.com/SonarSource)
